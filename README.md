SOME USEFUL MESSAGE WILL GO HERE
### Status: Metronome Screen UI is restored. Metronome Functionality in progress. Trackbuilder in progress. Back-end not started.

~~There is currently a "minimum working app", aka you can launch in Expo Go with SDK 54. However you will find that the app is... uhhhhh, not our app. It's the app from the Expo tutorial found [here](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/) (as of 12/05/2025).~~

Expo now uses TypeScript, and our original app used JavaScript, and there have been a whole bunch of upgrades that we failed to stay on top of, so it's not an easy "just update Expo and the dependencies" because the webpack something-or-other only allows up to SDK 50 and we're now on SDK 54. Thus, it is time to innovate anew and create a new Beatle. A Vampire Beatle, if you will.

Now what is a Vampire Beatle, you may ask? A Vampire Beatle is just as it sounds. It sucks your lifeblood and turns you into an undead ghoul. Its weakness is garlic. It is shaped like a bug. Did I just say bug? Our app has lots of bugs! Jk, it doesn't yet. Maybe it will after it has sustained lots of updates and the original code incompatibility is buried under 123 commits. Well, if you read all that, good for you. That's all from ME for now. Stay tuned for updates.

UPDATE (12/10/2025):
I have restored the entire UI of the main metronome screen (!!!) through the conversion of the AccentButtons, BoxyBox, Counters, PausePlayButton, SoundButton, and SoundSelection components to tsx files and incrementally restoring the main layout within the default Metronome screen function. I also fixed the bug with typing in tempos and BPM numbers where you could type in numbers outside of range/the code would try correcting the tempo/beat before you were done typing. The technical writing modal is partially restored. The component itself has been converted to TypeScript and pressing the '?' icon will pull up *a* modal, but the format is wonky and needs to be fixed. I suspect this is due to the usage of a Modal.tsx file in the original project instead of importing Modal from react-native. I have npm installed 2 things for this project so far: expo-router and react-native-dropdown-select-list. I have also set up simple navigation using Expo Router instead of react-navigation, because I don't believe Stack.Navigation is used within the new version(s) of Expo and/or React(?). Oh, and it currently works on both Android and web. I don't believe our final version of the original Beatle app actually worked on web, so I'll keep tabs on this as I proceed. Untested on iOS (but neither was the original, because we were all based enough to use Android).
