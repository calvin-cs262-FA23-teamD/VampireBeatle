SOME USEFUL MESSAGE WILL GO HERE
### Status: In Progress

There is currently a "minimum working app", aka you can launch in Expo Go with SDK 54. However you will find that the app is... uhhhhh, not our app. It's the app from the Expo tutorial found [here](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/) (as of 12/05/2025).

Expo now uses TypeScript, and our original app used JavaScript, and there have been a whole bunch of upgrades that we failed to stay on top of, so it's not an easy "just update Expo and the dependencies" because the webpack something-or-other only allows up to SDK 50 and we're now on SDK 54. Thus, it is time to innovate anew and create a new Beatle. A Vampire Beatle, if you will.

Now what is a Vampire Beatle, you may ask? A Vampire Beatle is just as it sounds. It sucks your lifeblood and turns you into an undead ghoul. Its weakness is garlic. It is shaped like a bug. Did I just say bug? Our app has lots of bugs! Jk, it doesn't yet. Maybe it will after it has sustained lots of updates and the original code incompatibility is buried under 123 commits. Well, if you read all that, good for you. That's all from ME for now. Stay tuned for updates. Goodbye.
